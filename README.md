# Storybook Knobs with Redux example

I made this project to show a "simple" way to update, with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org)
(and its [Knobs addon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/addon-knobs)), a Redux-connected
component.

I started from the basic [Redux Todo
example](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos).

To play with it:
```bash
npm i && npm run storybook
```
